            <div class="p">Shakespeare’s plays were immediately big hits! He wrote different kinds of plays, all
                of which could be divided into three categories:
                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li"><p class="p">Tragedy – including Hamlet,
                        Othello, King Lear and Romeo and Juliet</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li"><p class="p">Comedy – including Twelfth Night and the The
                        Taming of the Shrew</p>
</li>

                    <li class="li"><p class="p">History – including Henry IV, Henry V and Richard III</p>
</li>

                </ul>
</div>

            <div class="fig lceBox figborder"><span class="figcap"><span class="fig--title-label">Figure 1. </span>Did you know?</span>
                
                <p class="p">Plays in Shakespeare’s time were different to the ones we have today. There were
                    no female actors (women’s parts were played by men!), and audiences could be
                    very rowdy. They would shout, boo and even throw food at the actors they didn’t
                    like!</p>
